PCR/Manpreet
DNA replication
PCR = simple kind of DNA replication
In vivo:  naturally
In vitro: in lab / 
Nucleotides bases : G,C,A,T
DNA: double stranded. Complementary to each other.
 3’GCATTAG5’

Primer: short strand of dna. They are one strand? The shape is line?
 
Number of copies…? 

Primer is detached to One wire and help replication. Nucleotides are added…
Oligo nucleotide/ deoxy nucleoties..
Enzyme pick up the Nucleotides and create a copy of DNA strand..
DNA polymeraze
1.DNA template
2.Primer : on stretch of oligo nucleotides( single strand)
4.Polymerase enzyme(=taq polymeraze) : from thermophile(bacteria)
Cytoplasm…in cell
5. buffer: magnesium chloride, ..maintain ph stable during the process
 
In pcr, primer is artificially synthesized. 
Primer is also replicated in PCR
 Primer will be added to DNA template
Thermocycler(=pcr machine) …..we can set how many cycles…set temperature.
1Denaturation: 94-95’c strand get stranded
2Allealing:primer get attached to each strand . 50-60’c depends on primer 1min   G,C(triple bond..)
Enzyme is attached to primer..enzyme only look at primer…wrong place doesn’t care..
Chain alongation
3extension : get additional strand	 4min
…and the take them out and visualize using agros gel electrophoresis.
Agros..
Put in a buffer
Concentration methods…pore sizes…
1%-2% agros for performing agros gel electrophoresis.
Melt agros gel by adding some buffer(powder) and heat it 
Pour gel to Casting tray
Solidify….take the comb out
Inside of casting tray, there are Wells (comb shape)..
Add Itidium bromide to the agros gel
In the well, 
Dna is negative charge…it moves to positive charge(anode)
Loading die..
One well: dna
Other well: standard marker
Cloning(we use in lab. Making copies) vs synthesis (making something)| 
Vector….multiple copies
transluminator

Wash gell from …



Real time PCR / take mRNA (->cDNA)
RTPCR / covid…
Nested PCR / two set of primers.. highly specific…
Firstly amplified primers..secondly amplified …



Weak antigen
